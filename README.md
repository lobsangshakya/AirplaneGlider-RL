# Realistic Airplane Landing Simulator

A clean, lightweight 2D airplane landing simulator with realistic physics.

## Features

- Realistic thrust physics (fire one side → movement in opposite direction)
- Smooth airplane rotation and movement
- Gravity-based descent
- Proper landing/crash detection
- Clean visual design

## Quick Start

```bash
python run_airplane_lander.py
```

Then open http://localhost:8005

## Controls

- ← : Fire left engine (pushes plane RIGHT, tilts CLOCKWISE)
- → : Fire right engine (pushes plane LEFT, tilts COUNTER-CLOCKWISE)

## Physics

- Realistic thrust behavior
- Smooth rotation with momentum
- Natural stabilization
- Weight and inertia simulation
- Soft acceleration
